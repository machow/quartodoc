title: Configuring content
jupyter:
  kernelspec:
    display_name: Python 3 (ipykernel)
    language: python
    name: python3
---

Individual content entries (e.g. a function to be documented) can also be customized.
For example, if you are documenting a Python class, you may want to include or exclude
documentation on specific methods on that class.

Specify content options by setting `name: <content name>`, along with any additional options.

For example, below is a piece of content, MdRenderer, specified without options.

```yaml
contents:
  - MdRenderer
```

We set it to only document its render method, by setting `name: MdRenderer` followed by the `members` option.

```yaml
contents:
  - name: MdRenderer
    members:
      - render
```

In the following sections, we'll discuss different options for configuring content.


## Looking up objects

Finding Python objects to document involves two pieces of configuration:

* the package name.
* a list of objects for content.

Note that quartodoc can look up anything---whether functions, modules, classes, attributes, or methods.

```yaml
quartodoc:
  package: quartodoc
  sections:
    - title: Some section
      desc: ""
      contents:
        - get_object        # function: quartodoc.get_object
        - ast.preview       # submodule func: quartodoc.ast.preview
        - MdRenderer        # class: quartodoc.MdRenderer
        - MdRenderer.render # method: quartodoc.MDRenderer.render
        - renderers         # module: quartodoc.renderers
```

The functions listed in `contents` are assumed to be imported from the package.

## Module and class members

Documentation for modules and classes can automatically include their members (e.g. class methods and attributes; everything defined inside a module).

By default, all attributes and functions (including methods on a class) are documented by embedding them inside the module or class documentation.

There are four styles for presenting child members:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

# print out the attributes table of ChoicesChildren 
# this is overkill, but maybe a nice case of dogfooding
from quartodoc import get_object, MdRenderer
from quartodoc.builder.utils import extract_type
from griffe.docstrings.dataclasses import DocstringSectionAttributes

renderer = MdRenderer()
choices = get_object("quartodoc.layout.ChoicesChildren")
res = extract_type(DocstringSectionAttributes, choices.docstring.parsed)[0]

print(renderer.render(res))
```

You can specify a style by setting the `children` option in the config:

```yaml
quartodoc:
  package: quartodoc
  sections:
    - title: Some section
      desc: ""
      contents:

        # set the children option, so that methods get documented
        # on separate pages. MdRenderer's docs will include a summary
        # table that links to each page.
        - name: MdRenderer
          children: separate
```


## Setting default options

The section above showed how you can set options like `members:` and `children:` on content.
When specifying API documentation, you may need to specify the same options across multiple pieces of content.

Use the `options:` field in a section to specify options to apply across all content in that section.

For example, the config blocks below show how to document multiple classes without their members.

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

**Manual**

```yaml
quartodoc:
  package: quartodoc
  sections:
    - title: "Some section"

      # options set manually ---
      contents:
        - name: MdRenderer
          members: []
        - name: Builder
          members: []
```

:::
::: {.column}

**With options**

```yaml
quartodoc:
  package: quartodoc
  sections:
    - title: "Some section"

      # default options ---
      options:
        members: []
      
      contents:
        - MdRenderer
        - Builder
```

:::
::::::

Note that the **with options** block sets `members: []` inside `options`.
This sets `members: []` as the default for each piece of content.

### Reusing options

Options can be given a name, and re-used in multiple sections:

```yaml
- title: Some section
  options: &no-members
    members: []
  content:
    - ThingA
    - ThingB
- title: Another section
  options: *no-members
  content:
    - ThingC
```

The code above uses `&no-members` to name the options in the first section "no-members",
then `*no-members` to reference it in the second section.
The `&` and `*` are called an anchor and alias, respectively, in YAML.


### Where to put options

You can specify options in either the top-level config, or individual Sections.

```yaml
quartodoc:
  package: quartodoc

  # set options on the top-level config.
  # this will apply to all pieces of content.
  options:
    include_attributes: false
  sections:
    - contents:
        - MdRenderer

      # set options in an individual section.
      # in thise case, it resets include_attributes back
      # to defaulting as true
      options:
        include_attributes: true
        
```

## Specifying package path

Different levels of configuration let you set the `package` option.
This controls the package path that quartodoc will try to import control content from.

The example below shows three different places it can be set:
top-level site config, section config, or in a page element.

```yaml
# (1) package set on top-level site config
quartodoc:
  package: quartodoc
  sections:
    - title: ""
      desc: ""
      contents:
        - get_object         # quartodoc.get_object
    
    # (2) package set on a section
    - title: ""
      desc: ""
      package: quartodoc.ast
      contents:
        - preview            # quartodoc.ast.preview

        # (3) package set on a page
        - kind: page
          package: pandas
          contents:
            - DataFrame     # pandas.DataFrame
        
        # (4) package set on individual content entry
        - package: pandas
          name: Series
```

Use `package: null` to unset the package option. This enables you to specify objects using their full name.

```yaml
quartodoc:
  package: quartodoc
  sections:
    - title: ""
      desc: ""
      package: null
      contents:
        - quartodoc.get_object
```


## Dynamic lookup

By default, quartodoc uses static analysis to look up objects.
This means it gets information about your docstring without actually running your package's code.

This usually works well, but may get the docstring wrong for those created in an extremely dynamic way (e.g. you manually set the `__doc__` attribute on an object).

In this case, you can set the dynamic option on a piece of content.

```yaml
contents:
  - name: get_object
    dynamic: true
```


## Reference page sub-sections

quartodoc supports two levels of grouping on the reference page.
Use the `subtitle:` option to add an additional level of grouping.

For example, the code below creates an API reference page with one top-level section ("Some section"),
with two sub-sections inside it.


```yaml
quartodoc:
  package: quartodoc
  sections:
    - title: Some section

    - subtitle: Stuff A
      desc: This is subsection A
      contents:
        - MdRenderer

    - subtitle: Stuff B
      desc: This is subsection B
      contents:
        - get_object
```

## Grouping on a page

By default, content in each section gets included in the same index table,
with each piece of content documented on its own page.

For example, consider the config below.

```yaml
quartodoc:
  package: quartodoc
  sections:
    - title: Cool functions
      desc: ""
      contents:
        - get_object
        - name: MdRenderer
          members: ["render"]
```

Both `get_object` and `MdRenderer` will be:

* summarized and linked to in the "Cool functions" section of the index.
* documented on their own, separate pages.

### Page layout element

Use a custom page element to group object documentation on the same page.

Custom page elements are specified by including a `kind: <element name>` field.

:::::: {.columns}


::: {.column}

**Separate**

```yaml
quartodoc:
  package: quartodoc
  sections:
    - title: Cool functions
      desc: ""

      # normal contents setup ----
      contents:
        - get_object
        - name: MdRenderer
          members: ["render"]
```

:::
::: {.column}

**Grouped on same page**

```yaml
quartodoc:
  package: quartodoc
  sections:
    - title: Cool functions
      desc: ""

      # contents with a page grouping ----
      contents:
        - kind: page
          path: some_funcs
          contents:
            - get_object
            - name: MdRenderer
              members: ["render"]
```

:::
::::::

Note these three important pieces of the page entry:

* `kind: page` - indicates that we are creating a page
* `path:` - specifies what the name of the page will be in the generated docs.
  For example, `path: some_funcs` in the config above produces a file called
  `some_funcs.qmd` in the API reference folder.
* `contents:` - lists out the contents of the page.
